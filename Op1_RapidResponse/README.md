# Operation_1 Rapid Response: Code Red  
### Debrief:  
The main goal of **OP1RR:CR** is to **research QR Jacking and Scams**.  
Through this research we hope to glean a better understanding of how these kinds of attacks work.  
Obviously with the notion of finding how to prevent them.  

### How to participate:
Participation in SRT Ops is by permission only. **However** we post all of our findings openly.  
If you would like to join the Security Research Team | SSG we implore you to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/zRqrtb2yZB).  
Hang around and talk to us. If we feel you are a good fit we will vote to add you at which point  
it becomes majority rule.  

### OP :  
- Enumerate the various ways these attacks work
- Proof of concept attack emulation
- Figure out ways to prevent them
- Post findings to the SSG Website under the new SRT blog section.

### Happy Hacking.
It is only through experimenting and knowing that we learn how to better secure the future.
