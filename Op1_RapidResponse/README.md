## Operation_1 Rapid Response: Code Red  
---  
### Debrief:  
The main goal of OP1RR:CR is to research QR Jacking and Scams.  
Through this research we hope to glean a better understanding of how these kinds of attacks work.  
Obviously with the notion of finding how to prevent them.  

### Checklist:  
- [] Enumerate the various ways these attacks work
- [] Proof of concept attack emulation
- [] Figure out ways to prevent them
- [] Post findings to the SSG Website under the new SRT blog section.

### Happy Hacking.
It is only through experimenting and knowing that we learn how to better secure the future.
